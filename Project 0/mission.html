    <h1>TO PRODUCE WORLD-CLASS PACE BOWLERS FOR INDIA</h1>
    <p>Before 1987 there was an acute shortage of quality fast bowlers in India. 
        Concerned by this fact, Mr. Ravi Mammen, Managing Director of MRF, 
        decided to set up a premier Academy to develop world class pace bowlers for India.
           

    Mr.Ravi Mammen contacted the most successful pace bowler of that time - Dennis Lillee - to work with him.
         Together, they set-up the MRF Pace Foundation in August 1987.
         

    The MRF Pace Foundation conducted its first selection camp in 1987, in which aspirants from all over the country turned up for selections. 
        One of the aspirants to attend this selection camp was Sachin Tendulkar.</p>
        <br>
    <p>Under the leadership of Mr. Vinoo Mammen, the MRF Pace Foundation continued its successful journey, with several trainees â€“ including Javagal Srinath, Venkatesh Prasad, Zaheer Khan and Irfan Pathan - being selected to represent the country. 
        Till date, 17 trainees from the MRF Pace Foundation have played for India.
        

    In 2012, Dennis Lillee decided to retire, after spending 25 years as the Director of the MRF Pace Foundation. He passed on the torch to Glenn McGrath, 
        who is the most successful pace bowler in test cricket till date, and who had also attended the MRF Pace Foundation as a trainee in 1991.
        

    The MRF Pace Foundation continues its illustrious journey, with single-minded focus on its mission of producing world-class pace bowlers for India.</p>
